This cpp program reads, stores, computes, and sorts the overall grades of
students by utilizting data structures of both vector and list.

The Code::Block Management Tree looks like this:

Header Files:

grade.h – declare the functions as defined in grade.cpp

median.h – declare the functions as defined in median.cpp

Student_info.h – declare the functions as defined in Student_info.cpp, plus defining the data structure of the Student_info (object) type.

extract_fails.h - declare the fgrade function in extrac_fails.cpp.

Sources:

main.cpp – this is the first program that is run during the implementation phase.

grade.cpp – contains all functions relating to computing grades.

median.cpp – contains all functions relating to computing median.

Student_info.cpp – contains all functions relating to handling a Student_info object.

extract_fails.cpp - declare the def of fgrade (i.e. predicate of a failed grade) function and most importantly
4 versions of extract_fail functions by utilizing vector containerin version 1,2,3 and list container in version 4
to separate the failed graded student record into another container.
